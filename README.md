# Gleam.io Timer Speed-up

This can be used to speed up the timer on Gleam.io tasks. You can instantly complete any task related to time without waiting.
There will be a circle in the top left corner of the page with the text x1. You can click on it or press Control + 1 on your keyboard.
A pop-up message will appear. Here you can set how fast the time for the tasks should go.
The default setting is 1, which is the normal time. Recommended time multiplier: 1000 (1000 times faster)

Paste the total contents of the `gleam_timer.js` file (Ctrl + A and Ctrl + C) into your browser console (F12 or Ctrl + Shift + J)
when you are on an Gleam.io page.
